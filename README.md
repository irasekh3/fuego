# Fuego
Fuego is a library for automatically generating command line interfaces (CLIs) from golang functions and structs

> Concepts derived from and inspired by Google [python-fire](https://github.com/google/python-fire)

## Features
* quickly run and test your functions from the command line
* show documentation for functions and struct methods from the command line
* run / test existing external library functions or just use them as a cli
* turn external libraries into a simple CLI in as little as 4 lines

## Installation
```bash
go get github.com/irasekh3/fuego
```
